# Work Loop Instructions

Use this file when you are a fresh agent with no conversation context.

## First Reads

Read these files, in this order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `BOOTSTRAP_QUERY.md`
3. `cleanroom-input/MANIFEST.md`
4. `cleanroom-input/branch-coverage/source-branch-inventory.json`
5. `cleanroom-input/branch-coverage/reducer-route-inventory.json`
6. `tasks/LEVEL_1_2_SCOPE.md`
7. `tasks/ACTIVE_WORK.json`
8. `tasks/IMPLEMENTER_TASK.md`
9. `tasks/VALIDATION_REPORT.md`
10. `tasks/BLOCKERS.md`
11. `tasks/TARGET_REPLAY_EVIDENCE.example.json`

Do not read any file outside this repository. Do not read sibling repos.

## Pick The Next Branch Set

`tasks/ACTIVE_WORK.json` is the active assignment source. If the owner query
names an `assignmentId`, use that assignment. If it does not and exactly one
assignment exists, use that assignment. If more than one assignment exists and
none is named, stop and record a bootstrap blocker rather than choosing.

Only drivers in the selected assignment's lane queues are eligible. Drivers in
future queues, or drivers marked `out` or `flagged` in
`tasks/LEVEL_1_2_SCOPE.md`, are not Work Loop tasks until the source-owned
`branch-scope.jsonl` selects them and regenerates the cleanroom queue artifacts.

Do not reorder or edit `tasks/LEVEL_1_2_SCOPE.md` in the target repo. It is a
source-owned snapshot; if the queue is wrong, record a blocker and have the
source repo update `plans/cleanroom-branch-coverage/branch-scope.jsonl` and run
the branch-coverage write path.

`cleanroom-input/branch-coverage/source-branch-inventory.json` is the branch
denominator. A queued driver is complete only when every in-scope replayable
branch obligation for that driver has passing harness-generated target replay
evidence.

`cleanroom-input/branch-coverage/reducer-route-inventory.json` is the route
authority copied into the fresh package. Read the
`level-1-5-cleanroom-route-v1.freshCleanroomPackageGate` record, then match the
selected driver against `branchDecisionClasses` first and
`driverRouteAssignments` second. The matched route row tells whether the target
must use copied `qRoute` connector evidence, copied `qComponentRoute` component
evidence, replay-refresh evidence, catalog-after-substrate facts, or an explicit
blocker. Follow that row before using the broader level-1/2 queue.

`tasks/VALIDATION_REPORT.md` is the completion ledger. A queued branch set is
complete only when that report contains an entry that:

- names the exact `.mbt.qnt` driver;
- records the current manifest source commit SHA from
  `cleanroom-input/MANIFEST.md`;
- records the source branch inventory SHA;
- lists the allowed inputs used;
- records the behavior implemented;
- renders the generated branch coverage table from target replay evidence;
- records verification results for:
  - `cargo fmt --check`
  - `cargo test`
  - `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`
  - `node scripts/check-cleanroom-harness.cjs`

If a report entry names an old manifest source commit SHA or source branch
inventory SHA, treat it as historical unless it also has a current-snapshot
revalidation note.

To select work:

1. Find the selected assignment in `tasks/ACTIVE_WORK.json`.
2. Walk its lanes in listed order and each lane's queue in listed order.
3. Read each queued driver's in-scope branch obligations from source branch
   inventory.
4. Skip a queued driver only if `tasks/VALIDATION_REPORT.md` proves every in-scope
   replayable branch complete for the current manifest and source branch
   inventory.
5. Implement the first queued branch set that is not proven complete.
6. After the branch set is complete or blocked, return to step 1 and select the
   next eligible queued branch set. Do not stop after one branch set unless the
   selected assignment has no eligible incomplete work left, a repo-level
   blocker prevents further selection, or verification cannot be made green.

## Current Cursor

- Manifest source commit SHA: `564376fd95218a209bb9eae5c9ccb54ca3e04a52`
- Source branch inventory SHA: `4bb2b20a85d94e3b90b7c59cbfe6e1edd5ab3ef40410641e999527861f3d3a32`
- Last completed current-snapshot queued branch set: `<none>`
- Active assignment: `reducer-spine-diagnostic-battle`
- Next queued driver: `cleanroom-input/qnt/battle-runtime/battle-runtime-magic-missile.mbt.qnt`
- Next task id: `T001`

## Implementation Rules

For the selected branch set:

1. Write `tasks/START_GATE.json` with the next task id from the Current Cursor,
   current `HEAD`, clean pre-implementation worktree status, and selected
   assignment, lane, and drivers. Stop before implementation if the worktree is
   not clean before task edits begin.
2. Read the `.mbt.qnt` driver and its imported QNT files from
   `cleanroom-input/qnt/**`.
3. Read the relevant RAW from `cleanroom-input/raw/srd-5.2.1/**`.
4. Check `cleanroom-input/domain/UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md`.
5. Check `cleanroom-input/domain/CLEANROOM_ASSUMPTIONS.md`.
6. Check `cleanroom-input/branch-coverage/reducer-route-inventory.json` for the
   selected branch set. Match a branch-specific route row before the driver-level
   row. For `routeConnectorPath` or `routeConnectorPaths`, read the copied route
   connector and use its `qRoute` projection with the route event-list
   comparator as executable evidence. For `componentConnectorPath` or
   `component-first`, read the copied component connector and use its
   `qComponentRoute` projection with the component route event-list comparator.
   For `catalog-after-substrate`, `replay-refresh-only`, or explicit blockers,
   follow the row's stated substrate, replay, or blocker evidence instead of
   inventing a target-local substitute.
7. Check the relevant guidance files in `cleanroom-input/guidance/**`.
8. Implement the smallest Rust slice in `src` that makes
   the branch set conform.
9. Record or update `tasks/ENGINE_DEPTH_MANIFEST.json` for the production
   modules, domain APIs, adapter modules, quarantined witness names, and next
   reuse.
10. Record or update `tasks/STATE_OWNER_MANIFEST.json` for every durable field
    introduced or changed by the task.
11. Wire applicable executable QNT/MBT coverage through Rust quint-connect harness.
12. Add focused target-language tests only when they clarify RAW/QNT behavior or
    diagnose a documented conformance gap; these tests do not close branch
    coverage.
13. Run all required verification commands.
14. Write target replay evidence under `tasks/target-replay-evidence/`,
    matching `tasks/TARGET_REPLAY_EVIDENCE.example.json`.
15. Update `tasks/VALIDATION_REPORT.md`.
16. Update `tasks/BLOCKERS.md` only if the allowed corpus or target
    implementation remains insufficient.

If the selected branch set cannot be implemented from the allowed inputs,
record a blocker with the exact missing fact and move to the next eligible
queued branch set. Do not guess, and do not ask the owner during the run.

When a task is accepted, immediately start the next Work Loop iteration unless
one of the stop conditions above applies.

## Required Report Shape

Append a new section to `tasks/VALIDATION_REPORT.md` for each completed or
blocked implementation task. Use this shape:

```md
## TNNN: <driver basename or short behavior name>

- Manifest source commit SHA: `564376fd95218a209bb9eae5c9ccb54ca3e04a52`
- Source branch inventory SHA: `4bb2b20a85d94e3b90b7c59cbfe6e1edd5ab3ef40410641e999527861f3d3a32`
- Driver: `<exact queued .mbt.qnt path>`
- Branch obligations:
  - `<branch family>:<branch action>`
- Allowed inputs used:
  - `<path>`

Behavior implemented:

- ...

Generated branch coverage:

| Obligation | Target replay evidence | Diagnostic tests | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `<driver path>#<branch family>:<branch action>` | `tasks/target-replay-evidence/<file>.json#<trace id>#<branch family>:<branch action>` | `<diagnostic test path or none>` | `<covered|blocked>` |

Target replay evidence:

- Evidence file: `tasks/target-replay-evidence/<file>.json`
- Target profile SHA-256: `6d4cc6c6a4769962798133d57aff01438fb2b661941f71d1aa8a3333f4b7ecc1`
- Reproduction seed or trace id: `<seed or trace id>`

Remaining gaps:

- ...

Verification results:

- `cargo fmt --check` passed.
- `cargo test` passed.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` passed.
- `node scripts/check-cleanroom-harness.cjs` passed.
```

When you finish, also update the `Work Loop Status` section near the top of
`tasks/VALIDATION_REPORT.md` so the next fresh agent can resume without
conversation context.
